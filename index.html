                        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

<p>Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building websites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>

<p>For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.</p>

                <article><p>Web banner design is among the most prolific forms of marketing used in today’s online world and comes in all shapes and sizes. Web banner design is all about creating the most clickable banner ads possible.</p>
                    <p>Banner ads are advertisement images embedded on web pages that showcase a product or brand and link to the advertiser’s website. Most companies use them in one form or another because they’re an affordable, measurable and effective medium to increase brand awareness.</p>
                    <li>How do you design great banner ads?</li>
                    <li>Use the most effective, standard banner sizes</li>
                    <p>Purchase space on a website where your design will be featured above the fold and close to the main content of a page.</p>
                     <p>Banner ad design relies upon the right balance within each ad, so watch your hierarchy. Effective banner ads are designed to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to your website. They have three basic components:</p>
                     <p>Your company logo must be included to build brand awareness. Make sure it’s visually dominant, but not as dominant as the value proposition or the call to action.</p>

                <p>This article is for those of you who either are new to WordPress or are regular users who want to learn about the best way to run a WordPress website. We’ll be learning about working with domains, installing WordPress, managing content and using great plugins and themes to secure our website and make our content shine.</p>
                <p>I want to stress the same thing as I do when writing code-heavy articles: If you don’t understand everything here fully, don’t sweat it! Nothing is particularly difficult, but there is a lot to take in. We’ve all been there, we’ve all been confused by this stuff before. Don’t be afraid to get your feet wet and experiment; that’s how all of us learn about WordPress!</p>
                 <p><code>?edit=false&amp;view=true</code> are parameters — two of them, actually. The first key-value parameter is preceded by a question mark; all subsequent pairs are preceded by ampersands. The server-side code picks up on these values, and the values can be used to modify views or save data, for example.<code>#comment-5</code></p>

                <p>You may want to practice your writing, create a following, establish your brand, or use blogging as a marketing tool to increase site traffic. It’s also a great way to connect with like-minded people.</p>
                <p>There’s a wide choice of blogging platforms. The more choices there are, the harder it is to make up your mind.</p>
                <p>To help you choose the right blogging platform for yourself, we will first talk about what to look for in a blogging solution. After that, we’ll examine the pros and cons of the 10 best blog sites.</p>
                <p>An indispensable consideration. It’s not only important that your blogging platform of choice fits within your budget but what you also get for your money. A free offer is worth nothing if it doesn’t do what you need.</p>
                <p>Over time, your needs and requirements for your site will change. You might want to modify or overhaul the design, add features, or make other drastic changes. A good blogging platform needs to be able to accommodate that.</p>
                <p>How much hands-on work does your blogging solution need? Does it take care of most of the activities and features for you, or do you have to do everything by hand? This will have a serious impact on your workflow.</p>
